<p>In this blog post, I want to write about the things I personally like this opportunity.</p>
<p>
The thing I like the most in this internship is that I am getting to learn more and more technology. I am getting to learn stuff that I would never have thought of learning on my own. For example, through this internship, I am getting exposure to CUDA, a programming framework used for coding on the GPU. To be honest, before starting this internship, I never thought it is possible to write code that runs on the GPU. But, here I am, writing codes on the GPU on a daily basis. So far, I find it amusing how you write code on the GPU. It is a skill that is becoming more and more important due to the evolution of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Another thing I like is that I am getting an exposure to a professional workplace. I am learning how to act in a professional workplace. I think this particular skill will be very important for me when I start my life after college. I will graduate from college with a professional experience already in my bag.</p>
<p>
I also like the fact that I am getting to meet new people and learn from them. I am also getting to learn from their experiences and grow my knowledge in the process.</p>
<p>
So far, this has been a great experience. I am getting to learn a lot from it and becoming better and better at programming.</p>
