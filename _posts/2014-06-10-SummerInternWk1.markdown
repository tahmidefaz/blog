<h3><i>Prompt: What are you hoping to accomplish or learn (technical and/or non-technical) during your summer of research?</i></h3>
<p>Participation in the Summer Research at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte would give me first-hand exposure to research in the field of Computer Science. Through this opportunity, I intend to sharpen my analytical and problem-solving skills and learn research techniques which might help me in the future.  This summer research would help me gain knowledge in realms of computer science where I  have not set foot yet. Such topics would include parallel computing, GPU programming, and many others.</p>
