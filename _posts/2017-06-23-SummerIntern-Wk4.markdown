<h3>Week 4 Reflection</h3>
<p>I spent most of this week trying to get a better understanding of CUDA. 
CUDA is a platform that is used to perform computations on NVIDIA GPUs. 
CUDA allows a programmer to utilize the many cores that are inside a GPU. GPUs are built for parallel computing. 
Therefore, there is a good chance that algorithms executed on the GPU may have a faster runtime than that of performing on the CPU.</p>
<p>
There are some aspects of GPU computing that I do not fully understand yet. The architecture of GPU computation includes Blocks, which in turn contains Threads. 
Threads can be used in computations. Multiple threads can be launched at once - this is the concept of parallelism. This enables us to run multiple processes at once.
